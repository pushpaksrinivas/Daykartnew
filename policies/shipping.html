    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>At DayKart, we aim to provide a smooth and efficient shopping experience. Our shipping policy is designed to give you transparency regarding the handling and delivery of your orders.</p>

    <h2>1. Same-Day Shipping</h2>
    <p>We are proud to offer **same-day shipping** for orders placed before [Insert Cutoff Time] on business days (Monday to Friday, excluding holidays). Orders placed after the cutoff time or on weekends will be shipped the next business day.</p>

    <h2>2. Order Processing</h2>
    <p>All orders are processed promptly, and we strive to ship products as quickly as possible. However, if any issue arises with your order (e.g., payment failure, inventory issue, or order verification), there may be a **1-2 business day delay** in shipping while we resolve the issue.</p>
    <p>If your order experiences any delays, you will be notified by our customer support team with an update on the status of your shipment.</p>

    <h2>3. Shipping Methods & Delivery Times</h2>
    <p>We use reliable courier partners to ensure timely delivery. The expected delivery time will vary based on your location, the shipping method selected at checkout, and any potential unforeseen delays by our shipping partners. Typical delivery times are:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Standard Shipping: 3-5 business days</li>
        <li>Express Shipping: 1-2 business days (available for certain locations)</li>
    </ul>
    
    <p>Note: Delivery times are estimates and can be affected by weather conditions, holidays, or other circumstances beyond our control.</p>

    <h2>4. Shipping Costs</h2>
    <p>Shipping charges will be calculated at checkout based on the weight, size of the items, and delivery location. We offer free shipping on orders over 2199 INR.</p>

    <h2>5. Shipping Restrictions</h2>
    <p>At this time, we are only able to ship to addresses within INDIA. We do not offer international shipping at this time. However, this may change in the future, and we will update our shipping policy accordingly.</p>

    <h2>6. Tracking Your Order</h2>
    <p>Once your order is shipped, you will receive a tracking number via email or SMS. You can use this tracking number to monitor the status of your shipment on the carrier's website.</p>

    <h2>7. Shipping Issues & Customer Support</h2>
    <p>If there are any problems with your orderâ€™s shipping, such as delays or non-delivery, please contact our customer support team at <a href="mailto:daykart.services@gmail.com">daykart.services@gmail.com</a>.
